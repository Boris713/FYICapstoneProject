Emails: ElvaSalinas@example.com, AnnaRogers@example.com
Institution: San Diego City College
Description: Participants will learn to design integrative assignments that will connect students’ classroom learning to the cultural resources of their communities. San Diego City College sits in a rich urban environment in close proximity to one of the busiest crossroads of the international border, refugee resettlement communities, historic Latino barrios and African American neighborhoods. Surrounding communities can function as powerful assets for learning community practitioners focused on developing contextualized learning and promoting deeper critical thinking. This presentation will showcase integrative assignments that have been developed to capitalize on diverse student experiences by linking them to the cultural resources of the community. They draw on individual students’ backgrounds and experiences and expand them through experiential learning to promote critical reflection and analysis. Participants in this workshop will develop integrative assignments for implementation in their own classrooms that utilize local community resources.

Presenters: Greg Barker, Julia Spears, Stephanie Zobac
Emails: GregBarker@example.com, JuliaSpears@example.com, StephanieZobac@example.com
Institution: Northern Illinois University
Description: In this session, a full TLC cohort will be assessed using varied methodologies at multiple instances throughout one academic year. Mid-semester and end of semester surveys will be used to determine the students’ perception of TLC impact. End-of-semester comparisons of GPA and retention will be used to measure the influence of the TLC on student success. Furthermore, equivalent comparison groups will be created to address the self-selected nature of TLC groups. Students’ will also be queried at the end of their second semester to measure the lasting impact of their TLC experience. The session will end with a discussion of how this data can be used for program development to ensure continuous improvement of the overall TLC experience. We hope that through these varied and convergent assessment methods a complete picture of the TLC experience can be presented and provide a framework so other institutions can evaluate their own TLC’s.

Name: Incorporating Core Science Classes into Learning Communities
Day: Friday
Time: 9:45am - 10:30am
Room: Aransas
Presenters: Nick Richardson, Patricia Tooker
Emails: NickRichardson@example.com, PatriciaTooker@example.com
Institution: Wagner College
Description: Many learning communities are unable to integrate core, introductory science classes (such as general chemistry or biology), and instead non-majors science classes are often incorporated into the learning community instead. This leaves a large cohort of students (science majors, pre-health majors) unable to take a learning community directly linked to their academic interests. At Wagner College, as part of the Wagner Plan for the Practical Liberal Arts, we have been able to successfully place core science classes into learning communities without having to reduce the amount of material covered in the science course. We will discuss the structure employed to solve this problem, giving specific examples of freshman learning communities we have developed.

Room: Matagorda
Presenters: Elaine McLeod, Wanda Burwick
Emails: ElaineMcLeod.example.com, WandaBurwick@example.com
Institution: Midlands Technical College
Description: At Midlands Technical College, a two-year institution in Columbia, SC, many students begin the Information Systems Technology (IST) program academically under prepared and with little awareness of professionally appropriate use of technology. This gap in student experience and program expectations can be a barrier to student success and retention in a program heavily dominated by technology. To engage students and improve retention, faculty restructured introductory courses as learning communities. Task-oriented students collaborate in developing solutions and learn about benefits of teamwork in IT and community professional standards. Activities also tie technical skills to more general academic skills through information technology literacy and use of college services. Presenters discuss extending the notion of learning communities in entry level IT courses and provide examples of activities for hybrid and online learning environments as well as traditional classes. Audience participants will explore how shared learning experiences using technology can create community and student success.

Description: Many LCs and universities’ recruitment efforts focus on reaching students via standard mail, a school email account, and/or campus presentations. However these methods are relatively ineffective with first-generation college students and other at-risk populations that do not engage in these traditional ways. Recruitment strategies that engage this demographic frequently, in familiar spaces within their home communities are far more successful. In addition, involving parents and other family members is key to students’ “buy-in” to the benefits of LC programming. Coupling these strategies with culturally relevant recruiting materials and student testimony ensures greater success at reaching students and developing meaningful relationships during the recruitment process. Participants will learn about the strategies used by CBS Scholars Program at Wayne State University to successfully engage students in the recruitment process.

Room: Nueces A
Presenters: Terry Davin, Greg Sanford
Emails: TerryDavin@example.com, GregSanford@example.com
Institution: Metropolitan Community College - Penn Valley
Description: This interactive session will explore the generation of a themed learning community structured around a series of disciplinarily integrated student projects and assignments. The class title, Ancestors: Lives of the Ancients, expresses an important intersection between the disciplines of biology and history. From this conceptual starting point the class is structured around five integrative themes, each culminating in research-based student presentations and synthetic essays. The session will first examine the thematic integration of the class. The discussion will be guided by Emily Lardner’s and Gillies Malnarich’s recommendation to develop learning communities by modeling expert behavior; that is, how the two disciplines view, pursue value and share knowledge. The session will then turn to the integrated assignments for one of the units. This will be done with reference to the heuristic for designing and assessing integrative and purposeful assignments introduced by Veronica Boix-Mansilla and refined by Lardner and Malnarich.

Time: 10:45am - 11:30am
Room: Matagorda
Presenters: Hillary Steine, Michelle Dean
Emails: HillarySteine@example.com, MichelleDean@example.com
Institution: Kennesaw State University
Description: Many first-year students begin college aspiring to a career in a STEM field only to be discouraged by their lack of preparation for challenging courses like introductory chemistry. Learning strategies that enabled these students to be successful in high school science are no longer sufficient, and many students fail or withdraw from the class. This session will describe an attempt to improve student success, retention, and metacognition in an introductory chemistry course through a learning community that pairs the course with a specialized first-year seminar focusing on strategies for success in the sciences. Presenters will discuss the design, goals, assignments, and assessments of the specialized first-year seminar, as well as share data from a focus group interview of successful and non-successful former introductory chemistry students who inspired the course’s design.

Emails: AmyGarcia@example.com, KristaKozel@example.com
Institution: Doña Ana Community College
Description: Our aim is to discuss how a compressed hybrid learning community increases success and retention for under-prepared, at-risk, first generation developmental students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. At a southwestern community college, the students participating in this endeavor work collaboratively with two instructors to discuss, write, and present on a variety of issues related to the theme, Communication and Inquiry. This presentation will highlight steps the instructors focused upon when shifting from a compressed learning community toward a compressed hybrid learning community, applying team-teaching strategies, common assignments, integrated coursework, service learning, and uses of technology. The assessment methodology and the results of the shift from face-to-face to a hybrid format will be shared with session attendees. This initial pilot establishes groundwork for further study into the efficacy of hybrid compressed learning community courses for developmental students.

Institution: Utah Valley University
Description: A student’s chance request one semester was the genesis of what has evolved into a semester-long integrative assignment sequence in our learning community. After a semester of onthe-fly experimentation, we implemented the dovetailed assignment into our learning community curriculum, and doing so has made considerable difference in the achievements of the students in a Stress Management class that is linked with an English composition class. Our integrative assignments presentation will unfold largely as we experienced it: from a question to a full-participation enterprise that we implement in each learning community. Because assignments require both contemplation and a direct action, the element of experiential learning is strongly present. We will discuss the high academic achievement–and personal development in engaged learning–that results from the unexpected gift of a student-driven assignment sequence. A student will present with us, providing his or her insights regarding the workshop.

Time: 2:30pm - 3:15pm
Room: Nueces A
Presenters: James Gould, Ted Hazelgrove
Emails: JamesGould@example.com, TedHazelgrove@example.com
Institution: McHenry County College
Description: Many professors use films in college courses to engage students, present ideas, provide illustrations and make issues relevant. Too often, however, showing a film is simply a voyeuristic exercise – and students, while entertained, do not see it as a text that can foster meaningful learning. We use film – which students view outside of class and which we excerpt in class – for a different reason. Even in an LC, course topics can become disconnected from each other, with students experiencing them as unrelated fragments. In order to create a coherent learning experience, we use a different film to anchor each unit of our Philosophy and English course. These films provide an integrating hub to which the various spokes of the unit connect. In addition, films deepen understanding by connecting abstract ideas to concrete visual images and embedding them in a sustained narrative. In this interactive workshop we model how a film can be used to integrate disciplines and structure an entire course unit.

Institution: Holyoke Community College
Description: In addition to an interdisciplinary framework, learning communities, when seamlessly integrated, can transform a performer-spectator classroom by placing students in the center of learning and fostering a community where students experience all four stages of environmental sensitivity development as described by Bereznicki’s “Nesting Model.” “Carbon-Free Energy: Fantasy or Future” fully integrates “Introduction to Literature” and “Introduction to Clean Energy” in a second semester of the first-year learning community. From Hawthorne’s short stories, Jewett’s “A White Heron,” London’s “To Build a Fire,” to Frost’s poems, Nature has been portrayed as a devilish place of non-believers, an object to improve upon, a specimen to preserve, and something to dismiss, manipulate or conquer. Literary discussions in the context of renewable energy highlight the forest for the trees by debunking monolithic views of Nature, fostering environmental sensitivities, and creating a space for generating new mindscape where life style is connected with ecological footprint. This session delineates our LC structure, describe our application of the “Nesting Model,” and demonstrate the effectiveness of this experiential approach through students’ written work and video clips of classroom activities.

Institution: Iowa State University
Description: The Academy for Leadership and Learning (ALL), a cross-disciplinary community of first-year learners, was created to help students develop learning, teamwork, and leadership skills while they are becoming competent in their majors. Typically, during the first semester we observe individuals transform from students who wait to be told what to do and what to think into more responsible learners—those who begin to take control of their own growth and development. During fall 2012, this development was apparent earlier in the semester than it had been during any of the previous 6 years since the inception of the Academy. Therefore, a phenomenological research study was used to explore the perceptions of students who experienced ALL during fall 2012 to determine key components that most affected these students’ transformations as responsible learners. During our session we will share “lessons learned” about developing responsible learners that are applicable to all learning communities.

In the presentation, we will elucidate the five premises and discuss the ways that each deepens the learning-community experience. The premises promote mutual accountability and cultivation of a strong support network, sustaining engagement in both the curriculum and the cohort. We retain more at-risk students who become more successful in their classes and feel like rigorous scholars and writers. The premises also strengthen the perception of our themed learning community and illuminate connections in our integrative assignments--to the point that students and faculty alike refer to the learning community as “the class.” We consider the premises as the beginning of our shared journey; they provide a beautiful way to invite students into the academic community and to expand their learning beyond the walls of our classroom.

Description: What do more than 10,000 responses to the online survey of students’ experiences of learning in learning communities tell us about our LC programs—and, given our aims, what is working and needs work? Whether your campus is currently using the survey developed by the Washington Center in partnership with Skagit Valley College’s Office of Institutional Research, or you are thinking about adding it to your assessment toolbox, this interactive session will focus on the survey as a means for discovery and pro-active planning. After a brief overview of the survey design and purpose, we will explore a critical connection: what students say about “integrative learning and teaching” and their LC experience compared to other classes—and how participating two- and four- year institutions have used survey results to document the “LC difference” and to design faculty development.

Institution: Washington & Jefferson College
Description: : The professional roles of the co-presenters heavily influenced the curriculum of the themed learning community (TLC)/first-year seminar FYS, as they were employed in the campus Multicultural Success Center. This helped to inform how students were supported and challenged throughout the course. The Social Change Model of Leadership was used to aid in the facilitation of three important phases of developing multicultural understanding and leadership development: individual, group and community/society. This TLC/FYS combined public speaking fundamentals, composition, a first year seminar, an assigned academic advisor and an upper-class mentor to explore the unique individual backgrounds of the students. Additionally, our curriculum and course objectives provided the ideal space to challenge students to consider unexpected and controversial perspectives, in order to increase their understanding of diversity, privilege and power. The ultimate goal was to provide opportunities for students to acquire skills necessary to facilitate their success in a complex and multicultural society.

Institution: Kingsborough Community College, CUNY
Description: The Intensive ESL Learning Community Program at Kingsborough Community College, CUNY, a one-semester program, has been running successfully since 1995. Despite positive outcomes, recent data show that without the continued support and rigor of the learning community setting, some program benefits are weakened as students progress beyond their first-term experience. Given this evidence, we designed and implemented a year-long learning community option for ESL freshmen: Accelerated College ESL (ACE). The interconnected, broadened curriculum was revised to more deeply reflect a number of sociocultural principles (Vygotsky, 1978), including the promotion of individualized instruction, multimodality, and collaborative, project-based learning. Our presentation will demonstrate an assessment of ACE using a mixed methods approach. We will explore the potential in providing more structured learning community support over time for at-risk students, and based on our experience, offer suggestions for administrators, evaluators, and educators looking to expand learning community offerings on their campuses.

Description: The results from the Fall 2012-Fall 2013 validation study for the Online Survey of Students’ Experiences of Learning in Learning Communities includes unexpected findings in relation to students’ interpretation of survey questions. Students surveyed included those from two- and four-year institutions and those enrolled in pre-college to college-level studies. In this session, we will review the validation study design as a context for thinking about what we discovered when students write about and discuss their understanding of what the online survey questions “really mean.” Come prepared to imagine the online survey as more than a means to document the LC difference or design faculty development. Could the survey results also be used by students as a starting point to articulate and assess their learning in the company of peers? We will use selected student excerpts as a prompt for thinking about possibilities.

Institution: South Dakota State University
Description: In Fall 2012 learning communities hit our university like a tsunami when over 100 were implemented the first year, and we as faculty were assigned to them with minimal training or understanding. We chose to attend the 2012 NLCC and came away inspired. We shared suggestions for moving forward using best practices learned at the NLCC with our LC administrators. They heard us, yet few suggestions have been implemented. Within our own department, we have chosen to focus on letting go of our concerns and shifting our focus to that which we can control. For Fall 2013 we have created several learning communities within our own department combining First Year Seminar courses with Exploratory Studies courses and using Gallup’s Strengths and the StrengthFinder 2.0 assessment as an integrative thread. This session will highlight the concept of shifting focus from the concerns faced in universal implementation of learning communities to focusing on the aspects that faculty can control.

Description: This session explores the challenge of transitioning adult English Language Learners from Adult Education to college-level courses, in particular, to a college-level composition course. As the percentage of English Language Learners increases, especially in community colleges, it is imperative for administration and faculty to become competent in the placement and best teaching practices for this unique population. Instead of the traditional placement route through developmental coursework, this collaboration between college composition and ESL faculty bypassed traditional placement procedures and targeted support for the specific developmental needs of the language learner. In addition to promoting academic success, this learning community created an environment that nurtured student confidence and developed a network of support for students as they transitioned independently to other courses. This session will describe the development and implementation of this learning community. It will also share student reflections on the impact of the community on their educational goals.

Institution: Southern Methodist University
Description: Technology provides new ways for students to receive first contact with material and better ways to ensure that students are prepared for class. We will begin by searching for new sources of online content and exploring the benefits of podcasts and online exams. We will play games and practice creating active learning assignments that use free internet content, laptops, tablets or phones in or out of the classroom. Technology can be used to lower the stakes and raise standards with micro tests, improve reading and writing, and even create opportunities to study source documents. All of these offer opportunities to spark the sort of critical thinking or change of mental models we seek. If technology can give us more classroom time, how can we design experiences that will maximize change in our students? Dee Fink provides an excellent model for designing courses, but technology creates many more opportunities to rethink the sequence of activities. We will examine how first contact, learning activities and assessment can all be reworked to focus students on learning

Institution: Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi
Description: We have employed learning communities for our first-year students for almost 20 years with varying success. However, we found that our most recent students were not as academically prepared as those in the past, and therefore our retention rate for first-year students was slipping. Several concerned faculty and administrators created a basic skills learning community which was significantly smaller than our other learning communities. With dedicated professionals staffing the learning community, we found the smaller, focused learning community improved retention, even among at-risk students. We present data which support the effectiveness of a smaller learning community enthusiastically focused on success and retention of at-risk students. We also review strategies and tactics which we believe have made our learning communities successful.

Description: How do campuses currently assess their learning community programs, and what do they wish they could do? These questions are at the heart of the LC Evaluation Project, a multi-year project organized by Washington Center. In spring 2013, learning community coordinators were asked to respond to a survey about the outcomes they were assessing and the tools they were using to assess those outcomes. They were also asked to identify outcomes they would like to assess if the appropriate tools were available. We will report on the results of the survey, and describe the second phase of this work, in which campuses are invited to experiment with a shared set of assessment tools as part of a national action research project.

Description: The “Girl Talk” learning communities at Kennesaw State University are devoted to helping young women transition to college while expanding their awareness of global conditions. Through integrated assignments (Psychology, English, First-Year Seminar) and out-of-class activities, first-year female students explore the living conditions of women and children around the world, including their struggles for human rights, freedom, and power. Students design and implement service projects to make a positive difference for women in another part of the world. In 2012, Girl Talk students focused on the women and children of Haiti, and in 2013 the focus is on the women of India. Under faculty guidance, undergraduate researchers developed a survey instrument to measure student perceptions of global awareness and citizenship. In this presentation, we will share the story of “Girl Talk,” one of KSU’s most popular and successful LCs. We’ll highlight student work and share nascent findings of undergraduate research.

Description: Both research and writing skills are essential for success in college and beyond, but first-semester freshmen do not always recognize the importance of these skills. By integrating a research skills course and a writing course within a learning community, students were able to apply these skills in their projects that integrated the learning community themes. The instructors worked together to scaffold assignments and assess similar learning outcomes. Ultimately, students in the learning community were more engaged in the process of research and had greater capacity to research for their writing assignments than if the two courses were separated.

Description: Planning a successful learning community generally involves participating in “tried and true” Learning Communities 101 experimentation. And teaching teams typically experience the greatest boost of creative, cognitive energy as they pull together the initial pieces of their LC puzzles. However, what happens at the end of a semester as they deconstruct the LC--when they discover that some things worked as planned and others did not? How does a team of faculty begin the process of identifying the hits as well as the misses? How do they muster energy and joy from the successes of an LC and parlay them into addressing the shortcomings? In this presentation, three LC faculty will share insights on how they examined, revised, and revived a learning community combining College Success Seminar, Composition I, and Introduction of Sociology.

Description: The Key Communities are intensive, intentional, structured and diverse (50% ethnically diverse, 60% first-generation to college, 40% pell-eligible) Learning Communities at Colorado State University with structured integration of the curriculum and co-curriculum in order to increase retention, engagement, and academic success. Created as a response to data depicting lower academic performance and retention of diverse students, Key has become an integral strategy for student success. This presentation will share the overall model of the Key Communities (purpose, structure, curricular and co-curricular integration, staffing, partnerships), and the results of a research study which showed the positive impact of participating in Key Communities on student success as measured by first year retention and the deep approaches to learning scale obtained from the National Survey for Student Engagement. This study utilized regression models to explore the impact of the Key Communities on student success after controlling for prior academic preparation and student demographic characteristics.

Description: American higher education institutions are anxious to adopt programs and practices that attract, retain and graduate larger numbers of students from low-income, first generation backgrounds. This session shares four essential categories that should be included in Learning Communities with such students. These four essential areas include: social well-being, psychological well-being, academic support, financial literacy. Each of these four areas contain specific bodies of information, experiences, activities that should be acknowledged and integrated in the Learning Community setting. These areas provide a strong foundation on which students can build to complete their degrees.

Description: In Spring 2013, we taught a Learning Community that combined the science of astronomy with science fiction literature. This pairing was meant to draw upon the popularity of science fiction in order to stimulate student interest in science. At the same time, the engagement with hard science in a literature course enhances students’ analytical abilities. In this session, we will describe the rationale of the course and the challenges in combining two very different disciplines. We also share how the opportunity to witness the pedagogies of another discipline enhanced the level of instruction in all our courses. During the presentation, we will engage the audience in a group activity that was used in the course.

Description: For two years, study skills have been emphasized in a psychology/composition learning community. As a follow-up to a presentation at the 2012 meeting, several transformations were made, for example a more intentional incorporation of the “testing effect” as well as an assignment related to Dewey’s “The ‘6 hour D’ and how to avoid it.” In this presentation, we will discuss the results in terms of class assignments and exams, but now we can also incorporate the students’ perspective. This year’s students were explicitly told that they were research participants and were shown data from the past semester’s study skills incorporation research. Input on the effects of study skills inclusion was sought out from three types of students: those who dropped, those who stopped attending but didn’t drop, and those who completed. Comparisons between sections of the learning community, across semesters, and to non-learning-community sections will be explored.

Description: The Drexel University Engineering Learning Community (ELC) is a longstanding living-learning program of 40 first-year students who participate in housing, academic and co-curricular programming. In 2011, new college leadership led to a renewed interest in the Engineering Learning Community program. This presentation will share the data and assessment advisors presented to college leadership and demonstrate how this conversation led to a growth initiative that would double learning community offerings for 2013 (offering two instead of one) and 2014 (offering four instead of two). Advisors encountered many roadblocks to growing the program including getting faculty engagement, theme development, and housing space procurement. Presenters will highlight taking advantage of existing resources and structures, the importance of an implementation timeline, and how to best maximize efforts without wasting energy and resources. The session will end with participants sharing their own experiences with growing and developing learning community programs.

Description: The researchers will present the design and preliminary results of a study comparing three curricular variables in teaching American history in terms of their effects upon student abilities to think at levels beyond Piaget’s formal operational level. These variables are a traditional lecture, a problem based learning approach, and a problem based learning approach combined with an integrated first year seminar to form learning communities. The learning objectives of the first year seminar include strategies for academic success, life and motivational skills and the foundations for global learning and the lesson plans developed to accomplish these have been structured to focus student development on success in the American history curriculum. In addition, students in the first year seminar were provided additional opportunities to debrief and reflect upon their experiences in the problem based learning exercises.

Description: The University of South Alabama (USA) was a comparatively late adopter of Learning Communities (LCs), but in the 2 years since they were first widely offered, many faculty have come to be strong advocates of them. Our data generally confirm higher success rates for students who took classes that were incorporated into LCs than those that took them in unlinked traditional sections. However, USA has recently initiated a new educational enhancement plan that is encouraging the incorporation of the Team Based Learning (TBL) model for improving student learning in our classes. Consequently, many LC instructors are considering incorporating TBL strategies into their LC offerings. This presentation will examine how and why some USA faculty are contemplating merging TBL in LC classes.

Description: “One Health” identifies the interaction and complexity of the agricultural, ecological, medical, and veterinary sciences for contributing to the sustainability and improvement in quality of life for humans, animals, and the natural environment. During the Spring 2013 semester, a cohort of 22 Texas A&M University freshmen in the Animal Science and Biomedical Science curricula met weekly to discuss varying aspects of the “One Health” framework. Students were visited by experts from a variety of disciplines, including architecture, infectious diseases, food processing and safety, and reproductive physiology. Additionally, students visited various teaching and research facilities on the Texas A&M University campus. This presentation will describe key learnings from the completion of this “One Health”-themed learning community, discussing identified opportunities for enhancing student learning in future iterations and describing vision for development of new “One Health”-focused learning communities and high-impact learning experiences for Texas A&M University students.

Description: LCs are powerful tools for helping students connect more readily, successfully, and completely to their college experiences. However, those goals are often lost in measuring success solely by retention and graduation rates. Such rates are by-products – indicators – that other vital elements were successfully developed and managed. This session will focus on structures and practices that enhance Purdue University LC student experiences, evidenced by dramatic increases in planned events, curricular connection, participation, and student contact hours. Data also demonstrate a tremendous shift from primarily social events to an emphasis on events with academic and campus resource connections.

Institution: Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi
Description: Incorporating a literature assignment into our history learning community has given students the chance to reconnect with reading in ways that both develop their habits of reading and bridge conceptual discussions between composition and history content. Our methodology involves finding contemporary texts that share a common theme with the goals of the history lecture and creating an assignment that allows the students to explore that theme in a personal way. This presentation explores the benefits of such an integrative project in terms of student participation, community building, critical analysis, and habits of learning. We argue that contemporary literature has an advantageous role in LC effectiveness and welcome questions or ideas about what kind of literature could work best.

Description: Student Programing is often underfunded but an integral part of the student experience. Our presentation will demonstrate how to keep your funding and garner more funding through the use of quality program assessment. Program assessment allows program coordinators, directors, or staff to be more accountable and transparent, which then results in program sustainability, justification and credibility. Participants will leave with the tools to implement their own program assessment for their university. This assessment model was based on our learning community program but can be modified for most student-focused programs.

Description: IRL pedagogy is a dynamic educational practice. It consists of engaging students in collaborative learning in the TLC by developing higher-order processing skills, including critical thinking, competent communication, and the enhanced ability to integrate and apply knowledge through their reflections on a high-impact experience. For the past two years, we have seen how this pedagogy promoted understanding, reflection, and deeper learning. In our own collegial discourse and reflection, however, our team identified some significant barriers to student learning. Particularly, we identified their first-generation status, the transition to college learning and adulthood, commuting to campus, their heavy workloads, a reliance on cliques, and their attitudes of overconfidence. We thus worked together to create a “learning rubric” to enhance our methods for promoting students’ learning competencies. This presentation will highlight the progress we have made so far in student learning-through-reflection-based practices and discuss how students can be active participants in their own learning.

Description: Students often arrive at colleges and universities without the skills needed for success in their academic endeavors. In the Academy for Leadership and Learning (ALL), a first-year community of learners, students participate in a set of cross-disciplinary courses to develop learning, teamwork, and leadership abilities. In fall, 2012, new emphasis was placed on creating opportunities for students to discover the link between effort and achievement. We developed a tracking tool for students to rate achievement for learning outcomes in their core academic courses, provide evidence for their ratings, and plan for greater achievement. Next, we provided a grid for students to identify factors that interfered with their learning and specific efforts they could exert to enhance their learning. In sequence, these tools were very effective to reveal the connection between effort and achievement, and supported students as they became responsible learners, better prepared to navigate the rigors of academic life.

Description: Like a stone dropped into a pool of still water, a slight shift in emphasis and availability of professional development resources can produce expanding waves of change; impacting students, faculty and collegiate culture. It is a fact of life that adjuncts teach many of the developmental education courses-and indeed a large percentage of all first year courses. They are on the front lines; very often a student’s first college experience is in a classroom with an adjunct instructor. Involving adjuncts in the design and development of integrative assignments and learning communities at an early stage can produce big dividends in terms of propagating best practices, improving student engagement and success, providing opportunities to better integrate adjuncts into the faculty community, and even increasing their marketability and future employment prospects. Providing professional development opportunities that embrace and empower the adjunct faculty will produce an ever-widening ripple of positive energy.

Description: The Sea Aggies Involved in Learning (SAIL) program is the provisional admission program at Texas A&M University Galveston (TAMUG). SAIL students are enrolled in summer courses linked to a Living Learning Community (LLC) that assists in academic development and college transition. Prior to the summer of 2011, the TAMUG gateway (Bridge) program did not use an LLC to support its students. Only 39 % of students who attended the 2010 Bridge program returned the following academic year; whereas, 45% of students who attended the 2011 SAIL program with LLC support returned. Of the students that persisted into their sophomore year at TAMUG, 59% of the Bridge students’ cumulative GPA’s fell below 3.0, while only 6% of the SAIL students’ GPA’s fell below 3.0. This data suggests that using an LLC as an academic support network for provisional admission students increases retention and provides a greater chance of academic success.
